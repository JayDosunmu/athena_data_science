The poems and short stories read and discussed in this unit share similar themes:  they deal with personal choices and decisions.   In your essay for Unit One, you will also reflect on a time you had to make a choice, and compose a narrative essay based on that decision.\r\nNarratives vs Narrative Essays\r\n\r\nIn ENGL 1102 you will read a variety of narratives, or stories, written for a variety of intents: to inform, entertain, persuade, or simply as works of art.  Narrative Essays, however, are different, as you may remember from your ENGL 1101 textbook.  Narrative essays are essays in standard essay format (thesis statements within the introduction paragraph and supporting evidence in the body paragraphs) but they use stories to prove the thesis statement.  In this case, the narrative, or story, is used within the body paragraphs to prove the topic sentences.  When you share your story in this assignment, do not forget that you are sharing it for a purpose: to prove your thesis. \r\n\r\nFor this assignment, you may pick from the following topics and narrow it specifically to suit your content and focus.\r\n\r\n    Write a narrative essay in which you tell the story of a time in which you acted perhaps nobly, possibly naively, like Sammy in Updike's \"A&P.\"  Would you make the same decision given the same opportunity again?  Why or why not?\r\n    Roethke's My Papa's Waltz\" can be interpreted a few ways; have you had an experience where you've been misunderstood or where you've misunderstood someone else or the world around you?   Write a narrative essay about this misunderstanding and how it led to a better understanding later.\r\n    Life is full of choices, as both the speaker and the pool players demonstrate in Brooks' \"We Real Cool.\"  Write a narrative essay in which you tell the story of a good choice you made and its results in your life and the lives of others.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\nLength:  Your narrative essay should be 475-525 words.  With this large word span, you should not go over or under this limit, so choose your topic wisely and edit your essay effectively.\r\n\r\nFormality:  This is a personal essay, so a first person narrative style is acceptable;  second person is not.  If you'd like to practice writing about the work of literature, you may write frame your narrative essay as a reader-response, including references to the work of literature in the writing prompt.  Do remember that this is a college-level essay, so it should be written at that level of academic formality.  Colloquialisms and slang should be used sparingly and only within dialogue should you choose to include dialogue between characters.\r\n\r\nMLA:  Standard MLA format applies to this essay.  The heading and page format must comply to MLA format.  No additional research is required or expected in this essay.  If you add references to the work of literature in the writing prompt, it must be cited accurately.", "instructor": "Ms. Kristen Westrick", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "email", "subject_number": 1, "subject": {"shorthand": "ENGL"}}, {"response_time": "2017-09-06T14:52:49.611726Z", "attachments": "https://athena-learning-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/media-production/Mission_Statement_2.docx", "new_responses": false, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Santiago", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Batty", "is_active": true, "user_type": "admin", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-06-14T20:06:28.929467Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-09-06T14:12:23.861563Z", "appointment_time": "2017-09-06T14:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Lismary", "problem": "Hello!

This restaurant is fun, inviting, and great for all ages. The dress wear is casual but not too casual. No Mas! Is located roughly eight minutes away from centennial Olympic park. I came here with my family, which was about twelve of us all together, five of which were children under the age of ten.  We did make reservations which was super simple. They had the table set up and everything when we arrived. \r\nNo Mas! Cantina is located on walker street in downtown Atlanta. As we arrived at the restaurant my gps kept saying we had arrived and I was very confused because you almost miss it. On our second drive around the block, at last there it was! It offers valet only to the parking lot directly behind it for two dollars, or you could spend your time driving around the nearby blocks looking for parking. We took the two-dollar parking! As you walk in your greeted with music that makes you want to instantly start dancing. The colors were bright blues and yellows and the designs on the walls really made it feel like I was in a small Mexico City on vacation. The beautiful lights of all colors and plants hanging from the walls and ceilings really bring you in. \r\nThe shop at No Mas! Cantina, which were located right when you walk in, offers any and everything you would have ever seen in a Mexican restaurant or straight out of Mexico City. They sell everything from furniture, lighting, and my favorite, handbags! Everything in their store is hand crafted so it gets a little pricey. One of their small all leather hand bags was about two hundred and eighty dollars. A little on the high side for me.  Every piece is different and unique and they take pride in that from what the store clerk told me. \r\n\tAs we were taken to our table were led up the stairs to the top part of the restraint which had windows all over to overlook some buildings and the community, and look down at the rest of the restaurant. It was extremely crowded so I was surprised that they had our table ready on time. The table already had cups of water and bowls of chips and salsa waiting for us.\r\nThe waiter was dressed in all black, black pants and black button up wasted no time telling us about their extravagant alcohol menu. They have a menu with about fifty plus different tequila drinks. They also have your everyday sodas and water and serve coffee. I ordered the No Mas! Margarita which was around nine dollars and it also came with a tall about 2-foot cup that you get to take home for five more dollars. I was in heaven I really was starting to feel like I was out on vacation!\r\n As we waited on our drinks we ordered two Queso Loco cheese dips, which was thirteen dollars. My drink arrived in about five minutes after ordering the appetizers. The drink was tangy with that bit of salty trim and the bite of tequila and lime! Perfect! Right after the drinks came the appetizer arrived. I have never had anything better in my life. The mix of all the meats and the thick, gooey, dripping bowl of cheese filled with chorizo, steak, and fajita chicken outdone with Pico de Gallo. Every bite you take is different! As we were indulging ourselves in cheese the waiter came around about fifteen minutes later. Which Is a little more than I would have wanted to wait. But the atmosphere and the Spanish music playing left room for some wait time. My boyfriend and I decided to share the steak fajitas for one which was nineteen dollars. As we waited on our food I see our waiter turn the corner with a steaming plate and I know it\u2019s mine! My mouth began to water just smelling the fresh cooked steak and the peppers and onions all mixed together. I have never had a steak that just melted in my mouth before. The meat fell apart with every bite I took!  No Mas! Cantina is one of a kind and I highly suggest going for dinner soon!", "instructor": "Dr Bruce", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "live", "subject_number": 999, "subject": {"shorthand": "engl"}}, {"response_time": "2017-09-13T17:39:53.726951Z", "attachments": "https://athena-learning-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/media-production/Rhetoric_Analysis.docx", "new_responses": false, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Moretti", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Batty", "is_active": true, "user_type": "admin", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-06-14T20:06:28.929467Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-09-11T20:13:20.760892Z", "appointment_time": "2017-09-09T23:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Mylena", "problem": "Good afternoon.\r\nI'd like to ask help about my writing.

While not being your average fast food restaurant Chipotle began to be the new hot spot for a quick bite. Reading the reviews online I think majority of the few star ratings are present due to people not bothering to write a review. Reading through them you would read that it wasn\u2019t offered properly or had dirty spots. But if you think about your experience in general, it\u2019s the best fast food, by taste and quality.\r\nI visited the Chipotle right by my house in Canton, Georgia. As soon as I walked in all I smelt was the fresh veggies and cilantro. The restaurant had dimmed lighting with a unique archestructure and atmosphere. It had huge windows all around which I am sure gives off a lot more light during the day but I was here after sunset. Everything was very simple, the tables were basic silver tables, had simple lights hanging down, all the colors were neutral, and the overall feeling was very comfortable and relaxed. I walked to the starting spot of the assembly line that had a smiling worker waiting on the other side of the glass. I stood back to read the brief menu hanging above our eye sight noticing that there were really just options of what shell you wanted, taco, bowl, or a burrito. It was a quick build your on type deal.\r\nI decided to go with a bowl, the worker laid out a brown bowl that looked very different from paper looking. I could tell it was a a fully compostable bowl by its texture and color. Through the line you start out with choosing what rice, beans, and meat you want even giving us the option of lettuce. The next \u201cstation\u201d is your veggies, salsa, sour cream, and cheeses. It seemed there was a substitute for every item for someone that had a food allergy or liking. I was paying close attention to each food item sitting in its pan and each looked so freshly made. All the salsas had vibrant colors offering a mild, medium, hot, and even a corn salsa with fresh cilantro cuts in it. Just by looking at their food items displayed right infront of you, you can tell how fresh it truly was. I went with white rice, steak, sour cream and their famous corn salsa on top.\r\nAlthough in the past they never have had queso, which gave Moes the upperhand in that area, I tried some of their guacamole and chips for an extra cost of $1.80. Rumors are they are working on making a queso that meets all of their food requirements but is not yet put out for tasting. I got to the cash register to look up to see their drink menu and was so shocked at how broad it was! They offered different sorts of liquors and beers you would most likely get in Mexican restaurants and even kids bottled sodas you don\u2019t normally see in restaurants. I went for a regular fountain drink and quickly checked out at a total of $8.64. I headed over to the drink station that sat alongside their tabasco options and silverware. I went and sat starting to eat my meal while still observing things going on around me until I noticed I was totally just zoned out eating my bowl. The atmosphere was so laid-back, even at a busy hour I was able to sit there and enjoy my meal while it wasn\u2019t crazy loud and hectic. The taste of the food was so good and fresh it was almost even pure.\r\nBeing under the \u201cfast food\u201d category, Chipotle definitely stands its place at the top. From the fast service to the food tasting all the way to serving sizes and prices, Chipotle exceeds every expectation you would hold. With their prices being around $7 or $8 dollars per person, depending on what you get, you will never leave there hungry. Their serving sizes are more than enough for a dinner and will fully fill you up for lunch sending you home with leftovers. I have never heard any negative experience with Chipotle from anybody I know and now I see why. Their areas were very clean, they held a fast pace service, the food is always cooked properly and given fresh, and the prices are more than fair for what you are getting.\r\nI will always recommend Chipotle as a go to eating spot. I am more than pleased with my whole experience here with the food, atmosphere, cleanliness, and prices.

Below is a copy of my essay and i will also attach the essay assignment.\r\n                                                                                   The Steak and Shake Restaurant\r\n.\r\n If you are looking for a great restaurant with delicious food, low prices, and a family-friendly environment; I have the place for you! Me and my family have frequented multiple restaurants in Atlanta; However, The Steak and Shake on Northside drive in Atlanta, Ga is one of family and I favorite spots when we want to enjoy a great meal, in a nice environment, for an outstanding price. \r\nFirst, when entering the Stake and Shake restaurant, one of the first gestures you appreciate upon entering the restaurant, is the warm, friendly welcome you are greeted with by the employees. All the employees both men and woman, were dressed in black pants, a white button-down shirt, and a black apron. The waitresses were attentive and wasted no time guiding us to our table and providing us with menus. While looking around I noticed that the restaurant was small; However, it was not over crowded whatsoever. After being seated, our waitress Provided us with a booster seat for my daughter and she then gave both of my kids a pack of crayons, with activity sheets to keep them occupied. This made my kids excited, and was a \u201cthumbs up to me\u201d from me towards their customer service. \r\nAs  I viewed the menu, I noticed that the prices were extremely low and the options weren\u2019t bad either. They offered meals such as: a triple steak bacon burger, a mushroom steak burger, a jalapeno steak burger, and other steak burgers options served with seasoned fries for the price of 3.99. Unbelievable, right? The menu also offered chicken tenders, Cole slaw, baked beans, mac and cheese and others all under 5.99.  There was also a second menu for milkshakes. Steak and shake has a variety of hand-made milkshakes that leave your mind spinning from the numerous options. They had choices that were as simple as banana strawberry and banana chocolate or you could try something more complex, like their frosted flake or caramel turtle. \r\nAfter taking about two to five minutes to decide what we wanted, it took no time for our waitress to be there at our table prepared to take our orders. Me and my spouse both ordered the triple bacon steak burger combo for 3.99; My son wanted hot-dogs with fries and my daughter had chicken tenders with mac and cheese. With a smile on her face, our waitress wrote down our orders and informed us that kid eat free every day. I couldn\u2019t believe it. This means we were going to get four meals for the price of two. This was amazing, yet I thought, \u201cwhat\u2019s the catch\u201d. It seemed too good to be true. I looked around the restaurant to see if I would see signs of uncleanliness or any signs that would reflect why the\r\nprices were so amazing; I then began to search for the food safety score, expecting to see something discerning, yet, there was nothing alarming at all. The restaurant was spic and span, the tables were clean and crumb free, the floors were shiny, and the score was a 99; even still, I felt it was too good to be true.\r\nWhile I procrastinated about what could be wrong with the restaurant, our waitress brought our food to the table. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d I said to the waitress, as I eye-balled the entrees. The presentation of our food was magnificent; Our entrees looked exactly like the images on the menus and tv commercials. My burger was true to size, and my kid\u2019s meals were well prepared and finely executed.  As I bit into my burger, my heart sunk in. I was overwhelmed with the flavor and moisture of the steak burger. The buns were toasted and soft; the bacon well cooked, and didn\u2019t have that artificial, plastic taste like other a lot of other fast food restaurant\u2019s bacon has and the fries were lightly seasoned and cooked well.  Over all I will continue to recommend this restaurant because the Steak and Shake on North avenue gave me a different perspective on fast-food; With their low prices, fast service; great food; excellent customer service, and nice-casual family environment, there is no reason not to love this restaurant.", "instructor": "", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "live", "subject_number": 1101, "subject": {"shorthand": "Engl"}}, {"response_time": "2017-09-17T19:02:28.293438Z", "attachments": "https://athena-learning-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/media-production/Resturant_Review_.docx", "new_responses": true, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Haney", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Batty", "is_active": true, "user_type": "admin", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-06-14T20:06:28.929467Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-09-16T13:30:30.895930Z", "appointment_time": "2017-09-16T13:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Christopher", "problem": "I have my first Essay due soon.

To do this, you'll need to select a restaurant that appeals to you, dine there, and report back to the class on your experience.\r\n\r\nThere's no real requirement about the restaurant you select, except that you cannot eat the food as take-out. You must eat the meal in the restaurant so that you can document your full experience and share it with your readers. You may choose a restaurant that you frequent or take a chance on a new or unfamiliar restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe meal you review is also your choice: breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Feel free to go alone to conduct your review or take a companion or group. The benefit of dining alone is that you can absorb the full experience and atmosphere of the restaurant and have adequate time to take notes and document the full experience\r\nFor this essay, you'll be the primary source of information. Your audience will be relying on your personal, first-hand experience. Therefore, the research for this essay will be conducted directly by you. The restaurant you select and the food served will be your research topic.\r\nFirst person (I, me, my, we, etc.) will be imperative to convey your message and recommendation.\r\nRemember to think descriptively about your experience. Successful reviews will engage all five of the senses, so explain to your readers what you see, taste, touch, hear, and smell. (Note also that touch doesn't necessarily stop with what your hands feel; think also about the textures of the food you're eating, as this is an aspect of touch, as well.)\r\nThe restaurant and its location must be clearly identified within the essay. \r\nPricing should also be referenced in the essay, as well as your opinion on the reasonableness of the restaurant's prices. \r\nMany people want to know the Dress Code for restaurants they wish to visit, so consider including this in your review.\r\nA suitable, creative title should also be used to inform and engage your readers.\r\nYour goal is to paint a clear picture of the restaurant and provide vivid descriptions of the food. \r\nNote that saying something is \"delicious\" tells the reader nothing about the actual flavor, and therefore, words like delicious, tasty, disgusting should be avoided. Instead, think of more concrete, accurate words that might describe your taste experience.Remember that your goal is for your reader to share your experience with you, so try as best you can to recreate in words the sensations you're having while eating the food.\r\nWhile the food quality is important in a restaurant review, factor all other components of the experience into your review as well: the atmosphere of the restaurant, its wait staff, the chef (if you have any firsthand knowledge of him or her), the waiting area for seating, time you have to wait to be seated, parking, and so.\r\n\r\nDiscussion:  \r\nadd a comment\r\nNotifications", "instructor": "Dr. Bruce", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "email", "subject_number": 1101, "subject": {"shorthand": "Engl"}}, {"response_time": "2017-09-25T17:21:19.059176Z", "attachments": null, "new_responses": true, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Gomes", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Theo", "last_name": "Tate", "is_active": true, "user_type": "admin", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-06-14T19:47:03.379479Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-09-15T02:20:44.913383Z", "appointment_time": "2017-09-16T00:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Daiane", "problem": "Need help to review for test", "instructor": "Beckford", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "live", "subject_number": 1, "subject": {"shorthand": "Chem"}}, {"response_time": "2017-10-03T15:26:33.991458Z", "attachments": null, "new_responses": true, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Lawrence", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Batty", "is_active": true, "user_type": "admin", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-06-14T20:06:28.929467Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-09-30T13:05:10.047654Z", "appointment_time": "2017-09-30T12:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Carol", "problem": "Thanks for your reply.

The letter and speech we read by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. were written in 1963. What value, if any, do these messages hold more than fifty years later? The content of the essay will come from King's speech, his letter, and from your own personal experience or knowledge. You are not allowed to use any other sources for this essay. Remember, also, that this essay should focus on current situations and should not be a summation of King's legacy or the history of his work. This essay should examine how King's words are still useful and/or necessary today. \r\n\r\nIn 1963, African Americans were fighting to gain the same equal rights as White Americans. As we live in 2017, our society has come a long way from 1963, but we still have Americans fighting for their rights. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d & his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech still means a great deal to us as it did over 50 years ago. The LGBT community, the Muslim community, and even the African American are still fighting for their basic rights. \r\n\r\n2017 makes 54 years since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr has written his \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d  and the LGBT community is still fighting for their basic rights as if it was 54 years ago. A recent example of discrimination against the LGBTQ community is President Trump banning transgender from joining any branch of The United States Military. This is discrimination at it\u2019s best. Dr.King made a statement \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d(Letter from Birmingham Jail Dr. Martin Luther King Jr). He felt even if something not affecting you personally or your community, you are still obligated to speak up about the problem. When I see things like this happening in our society, it feels like we are taking a step back in time.\r\n\r\nMany Muslim Americans are still facing discrimination in 2017. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech he said \u201cWe must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\u201d(I have A Dream King). King didn\u2019t mind confronting issues that contain to racial injustice. He knew the only way to make things change was to speak out about the discrimination minorities experience every day.Since 9/11 many Muslim Americans have experienced several types of discrimination. The most recent experience of discrimination for the community is President Trump trying to issue ban Muslim countries. Even though I'm not a Muslim American, as American I can\u2019t just sit by and let their rights be targeted and discriminated against. The reason why is the same thing can happen to me or my family.  \r\n\r\nI am a young African American man, who has experienced racial discrimination several times in my life.I'm still in shock that we still have racism in our country in 2017. My first racial experience happen when I was a 10 at a summer camp. I was the only black kid in the entire camp. That summer I received several letters that told me to go back home to my black mama, you don\u2019t belong here, and they even went as far as them knocking down my tent several times. At that moment I realized racial still exist in our society. My parents sheltered me so much that I was oblivious to what was still going on in our society today.\r\n\r\nDr. King \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d & his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech still in relevant in today's time. We have come a long way as a nation, but still, have a long way to go. Many people still are being discriminated against every day, because of their race, gender, creed, and sexual orientation. Without Dr. King powerful letter and speech, we wouldn\u2019t have several rights today. 46 years after king standing up about the injustice we as a country elected our first African American president.

The letter and speech we read by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. were written in 1963.  What value, if any, do these messages hold more than fifty years later?  The content of the essay will come from King's speech, his letter, and from your own personal experience or knowledge.  You are not allowed to use any other sources for this essay.  Remember, also, that this essay should focus on current situations and should not be a summation of King's legacy or the history of his work.  This essay should examine how King's words are still useful and/or necessary today.  \r\n\r\nIn 1963, African Americans were fighting to gain the same equal rights as White Americans. As we live in 2017, our society has come a long way from 1963, but we still have a long way to go. Even in 2017 prejudices and racism still, exists in our society. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail,\u201d & his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech still means a great deal to us as it did over 50 years ago.\r\n2017 makes 54 years since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr has written his \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d and his words are still significant in our day in time as it was 54 years ago. Dr. King wrote the letter to respond to several clergymen who had written an open letter criticizing the actions in Birmingham and calling him an outsider. King wanted to explain to the men he wasn't an outsider coming to start trouble. He explains he is the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference that's based out of Atlanta but has several locations throughout the South, and he was invited Birmingham. He felt he had a moral responsibility, to speak up about the injustice that was happening in Birmingham. When Dr. King made the statement \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d(Dr. Martin Luther King Jr) He\u2019s saying even if something not affecting you personally you have to still speak up about the problem. Dr. King wasn't just fighting for African Americans, but for humanity. Many Americans are still facing threats to their basic right. African Americans, LGBTQ community, and Muslim Americans right are still under fire. A recent example of discrimination against the LGBTQ community is President Trump believe transgender shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the United States Military. I feel the government are moving the country back in time. These types of situations are the reason Dr. King fought so hard to change.\r\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech is one of the most powerful speeches given in the last 100 years. I believe King strongest message from the speech was \u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\u201d (King).  King, I have a dream speech help change many laws that were targeted against African Americans in this country for the better. King didn\u2019t mind confronting issues that contain to racial injustice. He knew the only way to make things change was to speak out about the discrimination minorities experience every day. If it wasn\u2019t for King \u201cI have a Dream\u201d speech, we wouldn\u2019t have elected our country first African American President. In that moment, most Americans felt that Dr. King dream had finally come true.\r\nI am a young African American man, who has experienced racial discrimination several times in my life. The first time I can remember my racial experience was when I was a 10 at a summer camp. I was the only black kid in the entire camp. That summer I received several letters that told me to go back home to my black mama, you don\u2019t belong here, and they even went as far as them knocking down my tent several times. At that moment, I realized racial still exist in our society. Even though racism still exists in our society, without King powerful letter and speech, we wouldn\u2019t have several rights today. 46 years after king standing up about the injustice we as a country elected our first African American president.

Some of Dr. King dreams as come true in away. \r\n \tDr. King\u2019s \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d and his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech are have come true in some ways. We have come a long way as a nation, but still, we have a long way to go. Many people are still discriminated against every day because of their race, gender, creed, and sexual orientation. Without Dr. King\u2019s powerful letter and speech, we wouldn\u2019t have several rights today. One example is just the right to vote. Forty-six years after King stood up about the injustice in the United States, we as a country elected our first African American president.

Both King and Wiesel convey the importance and complications of family in their writings.  Use the writings of these authors to demonstrate these relationship dynamics, or think about how the examples from these works might relate in some way to your own family relationships.  Have you struggled to ensure your children or parents received equal or better treatment than you or others?  How has the bond of family been challenging for you?  When have you most valued your family in your life, or have you faced times when you felt your family might be complicating your life?  These are just a few of the many questions stemming from our readings that might lead to potential essay topics in which you might use these readings as source material.  Once you've decided on a direction, compose an essay to your classmates in which you convey your message on the importance, complications, or value of family and how it relates to your own life or experience.  Use any or all of the readings as sources for this essay along with your personal experience. Be sure to quote or paraphrase from at least one of the readings in your essay, no matter which direction you take.  No other sources are allowed or needed besides those provided to you in this unit.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Value of Family\r\n\r\nThe value of family is just as important today as is was 60 years ago during the time of hatred and discrimination.  As a husband of 25 years and a parent of three, family is the most important thing to me.  Over the course of time, family structure has not changed.  The young receive knowledge, wisdom, safety, and protection from the elders.  Family can be supportive and encouraging as well as challenging and demanding.  \r\nChildren are heavily influenced by their parents\u2019 behavior and knowledge of right and wrong.  As children grow knowledge is past from farther to son and mother to daughter.  Hatred and discrimination is taught and learned just as reading and writing is.  Children learn more from their parents then we realize.  They learn how to love or hate, how to be fair or discriminate, and even their version of right or wrong.  When a child learns \u201call men are created equal\u201d and a parent lives by those principles then the child is more likely to live by those same principles and not pass judgement based on skin color (Dr. Martin Luther King).  However, if a child is raised in an environment where name calling, judging, and discriminating, based on religious beliefs, nationality, and the color of someone skin is acceptable, then that child is learning how to hate.  \r\nWhile absorbing knowledge from parents is important, safety, comfort, and even protection create an environment that most strong families embrace for the benefit of each family member.   It is a natural instinct for a parent to protect their young.  In the book Night by Eli Wiesel; when Eli and his family got off the train at Auschwitz, the family was divide.  Eli\u2019s mother stayed with his sister as Eli\u2019s father stayed with him.  Both parents were protecting the children from the unknown that was happening.  Eli himself said \u201cmy mother was my sister's fair hair, as though to protect her.\u201d  This quote demonstrates how close Eli\u2019s mother stayed close to his sister while trying to protect her, she was like the hair on her head.  Meanwhile, in a different section of the camp his father was gripping Eli\u2019s hand to not lose him in the crowd.  After seeing a man fall to ground in line behind him Eli grabbed his father\u2019s arm to lose him.  Eli felt a sense of security when he was with his father facing his unknown fate.  Even during the trying period of the concentration camp of Auschwitz a father is protecting his son and a mother is protecting her daughter while facing horrible unknown events. \r\nEach family member\u2019s willingness to support and help each other strengthens the bond of family and builds individual confidence.  Growing up with three brothers and one sister, who was the youngest, I realized that the family had to help one another to get through the hard times.   Dealing with a bully at school, studying for a test, or just doing chores around the house I knew that I could always rely on a brother or sister to help me out.  Now that I\u2019m older, I still count on my family for help.  For example, I have borrowed my brothers truck to move furniture and used their help remodeling my basement.  My family is always there for one another physically, emotionally, and even financially.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the importance of family, and the value to each of its members has not changed in years.  Even during dark times like the prison camps in world war two and the discrimination of the 1960\u2019s, families have made it through with the support of their family.  Adolescents are shown what is right and wrong through the actions of the Parents.  Every day I try to pass on wisdom and knowledge to my own children, while providing them all with a safe and loving home.  I know they understand the importance of the family unit just as I did growing up and respect the fact that family is the most valuable resource.", "instructor": "Dr. Phillip Bruce", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "email", "subject_number": 1101, "subject": {"shorthand": "Engl"}}, {"response_time": "2017-10-15T00:22:32.524539Z", "attachments": null, "new_responses": true, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Diaz", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Vu", "last_name": "Le", "is_active": true, "user_type": "tutor", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-10-13T12:12:19.544873Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-10-13T15:49:38.996290Z", "appointment_time": "2017-10-13T20:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Raymond", "problem": "I request help in Math (generally) considering I have trouble with Algebra frequently.

It was a time were segregation still exist. Fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. expressed his thoughts through his \"I Have a Dream\" speech and the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" Dr. King conveyed a readiness for equality. His message of equal opportunity, freedom, and the unity of our nation still holds value today. \r\n\r\nI was born in the ninety's, a time when African Americans were already freed from slavery and discrimination. Unlike Dr. King and fellow members of the Civil Rights Movement, whom fought day in and day out for their freedom. Dr. King said, \"We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights\" (\"Birmingham\"). He paved the way so that my generation could have their own independence. This gave us the opportunity to be free and to become whomever we want to be. \r\n\r\nDr. King and the Civil Rights Movement was the reason I was fortunate enough to grow up in a world with equal opportunities. I am able to attend public places such as restaurants, department stores and my local library because of desegregation. Dr. King wanted all Americans to be treated equally and have a voice in their community. He states, \" Now is the time to make justice a reality for all God's children\" (\"Speech\").  I now have the opportunity to exercise my right to vote because Dr. King's dream became a reality. Because of Dr. King, I don't have to face the disappointment of someone telling me I can't attend a certain school because of my skin color. I grew up not knowing what discrimination felt like. Today, I am given the same opportunities Dr. King fought for fifty years ago. \r\n\r\nAlthough racial discrimination still exists, our communities are standing together more than ever. Dr. King act of character influenced many to stand up for what they believe in. By doing this, African Americans have formed groups, one in particular, 'Black Lives Matter'. This organization was formed because of police brutality and it is their way of showing how they will stand for one another. The \"Black Lives Matter\" organization has shown numerous of times that a certain situation may not affect them directly, but they can come together and protest because an African Americans rights are being challenged. This group has also displayed the same courage as Dr. King did fifty years ago, by not fighting with their fist but fighting through protesting.  \r\n\r\nFifty years later, Dr. King's message still has a huge impact on individuals today. Our nation is sticking together because they know how important it is to be joined as one than to be divided. Rallies and political protests are becoming successful because the protestants are following in the footsteps of Dr. King. He we forever be a role model to generations in the future because he is the reason for us being free.", "instructor": "Phillip Bruce", "is_fulfilled": true, "method": "email", "subject_number": 1101, "subject": {"shorthand": "engl"}}, {"response_time": "2017-10-15T18:06:09.170892Z", "attachments": "https://athena-learning-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/media-production/Essay_2.docx", "new_responses": true, "semester": "", "student_last_name": "Haney", "responding_tutor": {"first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Batty", "is_active": true, "user_type": "admin", "is_staff": false, "date_joined": "2017-06-14T20:06:28.929467Z"}, "date_time_of_request": "2017-10-13T01:12:32.332798Z", "appointment_time": "2017-10-13T00:00:00Z", "student_first_name": "Christopher", "problem": "I know have some Grammar issues, I need help Proof Reading I have attach my Essay, and The Professor Instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nContent Requirements:\r\n\r\nWith Essay One, you conducted your own, individual research and used that information to serve as your source material (your ethos, or credibility) for your paper.

The letter and speech we read by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. were written in 1963.  What value, if any, do these messages hold more than fifty years later?  The content of the essay will come from King's speech, his letter, and from your own personal experience or knowledge.  You are not allowed to use any other sources for this essay.  Remember, also, that this essay should focus on current situations and should not be a summation of King's legacy or the history of his work.  This essay should examine how King's words are still useful and/or necessary today.   \r\n\r\nThank you so much!", "instructor": "Phillip Bruce", "is_fulfilled": false, "method": "email", "subject_number": 1101, "subject": {"shorthand": "engl"}}]
