The selling price to Yumminess would be $12 and $14.50 per tin, respectively, compared to the original $10 for Chocolate Attach Brownies. In addition to the current fixed common cost of $79,000, you have figured the additional costs to manufacture each new recipe. For 50,000 tins of Extra Attack Brownies, additional variable costs would be $75,000. For 20,000 tins of Nutty Attack Brownies, additional variable costs would be $100,000. Remember that the contribution margin for Chocolate Attack Brownies per tin is $1.995.\r\n\r\nAnswer questions 1 and 2 as a sell now or process further scenario.
